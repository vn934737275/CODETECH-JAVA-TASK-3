OVERVIEW:

The Number Guessing Game is a simple Java program where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts. The program provides hints like "too high" or "too low" after each guess to assist the player in narrowing down the correct answer.

Features:

    Random Number Generation: 
        The program utilizes the Random class to generate a random number between 1 and 100.
    User Interaction:
        The player interacts with the program by entering their guesses via the console.
    Hint System: 
        After each guess, the program provides hints indicating whether the guessed number is too high or too low relative to the secret number.
    Limited Attempts:
        The player has a maximum of 5 attempts to guess the correct number. If they fail to do so within the specified attempts, the game ends.

Implementation:

    Random Number Generation:
        The Random class is used to generate a random number between 1 and 100, inclusive.
        The generated random number represents the secret number that the player needs to guess.

    User Interaction:
        The program prompts the player to enter their guess via the console.
        Each guess is compared against the secret number to determine whether it is correct, too high, or too low.

    Hint System:
        After each guess, the program provides feedback to the player indicating whether their guess is too high or too low relative to the secret number.
        This feedback assists the player in adjusting their subsequent guesses to converge towards the correct answer.

    Limited Attempts:
        The player has a maximum of 5 attempts to guess the correct number.
        If the player guesses the correct number within the specified attempts, they win the game. Otherwise, they lose.

Usage:

    Compile the Program:

javac NumberGuessingGame.java

Run the Program:

    java NumberGuessingGame

    Gameplay:
        The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
        The player enters their guesses via the console and receives hints after each guess.
        The game ends when the player correctly guesses the number or runs out of attempts.

EXPLANATION:

The Number Guessing Game program is designed to provide an engaging and interactive experience for players to guess a randomly generated number. Here's how it works:

    Random Number Generation:
        The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the Random class.
    User Interaction:
        The player interacts with the program by entering their guesses via the console.
    Hint System: 
        After each guess, the program provides feedback to the player indicating whether their guess is too high or too low relative to the secret number.
    Limited Attempts: The player has a maximum of 5 attempts to guess the correct number. If they fail to do so within the specified attempts, the game ends.
